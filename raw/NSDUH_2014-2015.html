NOTE: Numbers in this table are based on national design-based estimates.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).<br>
<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <span class="italic">First use of marijuana</span> (or the average annual number of marijuana initiates) = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24&nbsp;months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: The Midwest region includes the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.<br>
<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>

Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>

Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available.

Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available.

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms.

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <span class="italic">First use of marijuana</span> (or the average annual initiation of marijuana expressed as a percentage) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24&nbsp;months and <span class="italic">X</span>2 is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as 0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>). Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms.

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>

Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>

Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> In 2015, a number of changes were made to the NSDUH questionnaire and data collection procedures resulting in the establishment of a new baseline for a number of measures. Therefore, estimates for several measures included in prior reports are not available. For details, see Section&nbsp;A of the "2014-2015 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <span class="italic">First use of marijuana</span> (or the average annual initiation of marijuana expressed as a percentage) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24&nbsp;months and <span class="italic">X</span>2 is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as 0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>). Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mental Illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Three categories of mental illness severity are defined based on the level of functional impairment: mild mental illness, moderate mental illness, and serious mental illness (SMI). Any mental illness (AMI) includes individuals in any of the three categories.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12&nbsp;months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
