NOTE: Numbers in this table are based on national design-based estimates.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011–2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006.

<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011–2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006.

<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana.

Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual number of marijuana initiates</em> = <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx</a>.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. Illicit Drugs Other Than Marijuana include cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. These estimates include data from original methamphetamine questions but do not include new methamphetamine items added in 2005 and 2006. See Section&nbsp;B.4.8 in Appendix&nbsp;B of the <em>Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings</em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> <em>Average annual marijuana initiation rate</em> = 100 × {[<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2}, where <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of persons who never used marijuana. Both of the computation components, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. Note that the age group is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Underage drinking is defined for persons aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not persons aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., chewing tobacco or snuff), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>7</sup> Needing But Not Receiving Treatment refers to respondents classified as needing treatment for illicit drugs (or alcohol), but not receiving treatment for an illicit drug (or alcohol) problem at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities [inpatient or outpatient], hospitals [inpatient only], and mental health centers).<br>
<sup>8</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
