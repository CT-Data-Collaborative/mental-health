NOTE: Numbers in this table are based on national design&#045;based estimates.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: The percentages in this table are based on national design&#045;based estimates.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
NOTE: The Northeast region includes the following states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: The Midwest region includes the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
NOTE: The South region includes the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.

<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: The West region includes the following states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).

Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).

Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).

<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).

Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span><span class="nowrap"> = <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &divide; 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span><span class="nowrap"> (%) = 100 &times; {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> &times; (0.5 &divide; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] &divide; 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at&#045;risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 &times; <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey&#045;weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the &quot;2016&#045;2017 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology&quot; at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the &quot;12+&quot; estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or &quot;snus&quot;), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV).<br>
<sup>9</sup> Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&mdash;Fourth Edition&mdash;Research Version&mdash;Axis I Disorders</span> (MHSS&#045;SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Respondents were asked, &quot;At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?&quot; If they answered &quot;Yes,&quot; they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 5th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM&#045;5), which specifies a period of at least 2&nbsp;weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
