NOTE: Numbers in this table are based on national design-based estimates.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.

<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>

<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 because estimated numbers are shown in thousands.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual number of marijuana initiates</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">= <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ 2,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>

NOTE: Estimates are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.<br>
<sup>3</sup> First Use of Marijuana is defined as follows: <span class="italic">Average annual initiation of marijuana</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">(%) = 100 × {[<span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> ÷ (0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>)] ÷ 2},</span> where <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub> is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as <span class="nowrap">0.5 × <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>).</span> Both of the computation components, <span class="italic">X</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub>2</sub>, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For details, see Section&nbsp;B of the "2015-2016 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology" at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/">https://www.samhsa.gov/data/</a>.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Binge Alcohol Use is defined as drinking five or more drinks (for males) or four or more drinks (for females) on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. In 2015, the definition for females changed from five to four drinks.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Underage drinking is defined for individuals aged 12 to 20; therefore, the "12+" estimate reflects that age group and not individuals aged 12 or older.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or "snus"), cigars, or pipe tobacco.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Substance Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV).<br>
<sup>10</sup> Respondents were classified as needing treatment for a substance use problem if they met the criteria for a substance use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center).<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mental illness is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) <span class="italic">Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis&nbsp;I Disorders</span> (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV). Any mental illness (AMI) includes adults with any mental disorder regardless of whether their disorder resulted in functional impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) includes adults with any mental disorder that resulted in serious functional impairment.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Mental health services are defined as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. Respondents were not to include treatment for drug or alcohol use.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Respondents were asked, "At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?" If they answered "Yes," they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Major depressive episode (MDE) is defined as in the 4th edition of the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when an individual experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older.<br>
